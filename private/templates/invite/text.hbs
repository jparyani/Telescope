Hi there,

The Sandstorm App Committee voting app is now live! Let’s take a moment to set it up in 3 easy steps:

Step 1) Log into your account at alpha.sandstorm.io. Don't worry if you don't have an account yet, just click "Sign In" on the top right and log in with either a Github or Google account.

Step 2) Please click this button to activate your alpha.sandstorm.io account for the voting app.

Step 3) Just kidding! There is no step 3. You’re done! Feel free to bookmark {{grainUrl}} so you can easily return to the voting app later.

Looking forward to your input!
